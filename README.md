# omfx

The batteries-included fork of [fx](https://github.com/vercel-labs/fx), Vercel's tiny, open, embeddable, native coding agent.

⚠ Status: Experimental. Use at your own risk.

fx is a coding agent harness and CLI written in Zig, optimized for research and embeddability as part of larger systems. It focuses on minimalism and performance across the board, from system prompt design to its tools, feature set, and 7.8 MiB binary. For end users, its CLI output style and form factor aim to be closer to a Unix shell than a heavy "IDE in the terminal" TUI.

omfx keeps all of that and adds batteries on top. It tracks upstream closely; `UPSTREAM.md` describes how. It's open source (Apache-2.0), model-agnostic, and suitable for both local and cloud inference.

The binary is named `omfx`. The build also installs an `fx`-named copy, so the upstream examples below work unchanged.

## Install

omfx does not have binary releases yet. Build it from source (see [Build from source](#build-from-source)), then put `zig-out/bin/omfx` on your `PATH`. The upstream `fx.sh` installer installs upstream fx, not omfx.

To build and install `omfx` into a `PATH` prefix in one step, run:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe -Dfx-alias=false --prefix ~/.local
```

`-Dfx-alias=false` skips the `fx`-named compatibility copy, so the install cannot shadow an upstream fx binary. The default build keeps the copy because the upstream test suites reference `zig-out/bin/fx`.

## Run fx

To get started, sign in with Vercel:

```bash
fx login
```

Or add an AI Gateway API key:

```bash
fx setup
```

Run fx from a project:

```bash
cd your_project
fx
```

The current directory becomes the primary workspace. Enter a prompt, or run `/help` to browse interactive commands.

List saved sessions with `fx sessions`. Resume the latest session for the current workspace, or select an exact session ID, through the same command group:

```bash
fx session resume last
fx session resume --id <id>
```

Each interactive session names its terminal tab. The title prefers the session name, falls back to the workspace name, and keeps the active model as secondary context. Renaming or resuming a session updates the tab, and exiting clears the fx-owned title. Noninteractive commands do not emit terminal-title controls.

Run `/feedback` to open the feedback form at `fx.sh/feedback`. It does not create a diagnostic or change the clipboard.

Run `/trace` to create a private Markdown diagnostic with logs, session context, runtime state, permissions, and recent activity. On macOS, fx copies the `.md` file to the clipboard; on other platforms, it saves the file and prints its path. Review and redact the trace before sharing it.

Use `fx ask` for a single request:

```bash
fx ask "explain the changes in this repository"
```

fx starts in `auto` permission mode. Routine understood development actions run directly; unresolved sensitive actions receive one bounded automatic review. A blocked action may return an exact approval request that the agent can send to fx's real permission screen. Ordinary question text never grants permission. See [Permissions](https://fx.sh/docs/configure-fx/permissions) for other modes and persistent rules.

JSON and quiet requests stay noninteractive by default. Add `--prompt-permissions` to allow the existing Y/N approval prompt when stdin is a TTY. Prompt text is written to stderr, so JSON stdout stays parseable and quiet stdout stays empty. Piped or redirected stdin remains noninteractive and fails instead of waiting for approval.

Inside a saved session, `/permissions remember <allow|deny> <tool-name> <arguments-json>` stores an exact confirmed rule without running the action. `/permissions` lists stable rule IDs, and `/permissions revoke <rule-id>` removes a stored rule even when its original workspace or file state has changed.

## Embed fx

fx builds as a native binary or WebAssembly. Applications embedding fx can provide network transport, session storage, configuration, permission handling, and terminal I/O.

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `fx acp` | Connect the native agent to editors and other Agent Client Protocol clients. |
| `createFxAgent()` | Embed the agent core in a JavaScript host with `fx-core.wasm`. |
| `createFxTerminal()` | Embed the interactive terminal with `fx-term.wasm`. |

The WebAssembly SDK is experimental. See the [WebAssembly SDK](sdk/README.md) and [ACP documentation](https://fx.sh/docs/using-fx/acp).

## Extend fx

Add reusable instructions with [skills](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/skills), connect external tools through [MCP](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/mcp), or delegate independent work to [subagents](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/subagents). Project instruction files may link within their scope, and read-only workspace or compatibility skill directories may link within their owning workspace or home; managed skills, `SKILL.md` files, resources, and escaping links remain no-follow. `fx status` and `fx doctor` report an invalid trusted MCP profile without starting its servers.

## Documentation

Read the [fx documentation](https://fx.sh/docs).

## Build from source

Building omfx requires [Zig 0.16.0+](https://ziglang.org/download/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/watzon/omfx.git
cd omfx
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
./zig-out/bin/omfx
```

Run the test suite with `zig build test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development and contribution guidelines.
